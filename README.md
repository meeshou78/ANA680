This dataset has approximately 683 patient data having 10 features and 1 class label describing whether the patient has cancer or not. Each row describes one patient, and the class column describes if the patient tumor is benign (label = 2) or malignant (label = 4). 
For this dataset, build all the classification models (using Python and Scikit-learn) given below (no need to visualize) and tabulate the accuracy and confusion matrix obtained for each. Split the dataset such that the test data size is 25% of the total dataset.
Make sure to code each classification model in a separate python file. Then, you can tabulate the accuracy and confusion matrix in a Word document table. Finally, submit all the python files and Word documents.
